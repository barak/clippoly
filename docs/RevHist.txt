Revision history for Macintosh port of clippoly code:

Version 1.5: gsl

Fixed bug in plotMClp m-file function which caused failure due to
incorrect indexing through the polygons to be clipped.

MatLab M-file pltpolys now can handle line types with up to 3 
characters instead of just 2.

Rewrote routine which determines the orientation of vertices in
a polygon (i.e. clockwise or counterclockwise). New algorithm
should be more computationally efficient and less prone to rounding
error, since only one cross-product is used versus N - 1 where N is
the number of polygon vertices.

Fixed a bug in the intersection code. A fuzzy check I had introduced
for parallel lines failed when one or both line segements were
very small. The check has been returned to its original state
where two segments are considered parallel only if their cross product
is identically zero. This fixed the bug found in test case gslBug2.

Changed some MEX code that wrote errors to stderr to now write to the
MatLab command window.

Ported code to MetroWerks CodeWarrior 10.0. CW now requires that the 
SIOUX library or console.stubs.c source file be present, if ANSI C or
ANSI C++ libraries are included in the link; therefore, I now include
console.stubs.c in in the MEX project. The old CW 9 project is still 
included in the distribution.

Inlining is now on by default. The CW 9 project still has inlining off by
default, since I no longer have this version on my system and cannot
edit the project file.

Instruction scheduling is now set to the 601 CPU by default. You should
recompile for your CPU. See the readme file under the compilation
heading for more info.

Added some guidelines to the readme file for submission of bug reports.

Ported code to MetroWerks CodeWarrior 11.0. CW no longer uses either
the SIOUX library or console.stubs.c source file. Also some of
the MetroWerks library names were changed and were placed in different
folders than in CW 10.0. This port required two types of changes to the
source code. (1) The string.h and poly.h header files had dummy definitions
of "class istream;" and "class ostream;" near the top of each respective
file. CW 11 choked on this declaring that these dummy definitions were
redeclarations.  Therefore, I removed the dummy definitions. (2) This 
necessitated a change in the order of several of the include files in 
several of the source files so that the iostream.h header file occurred
before any use of istream or ostream in string.h or poly.h. These changes
only affected the standalone executable. The MEX function code was 
unaffected, since it does not use istream or ostream.

In CW 11 MetroWerks removed the definition of the constant pi in math.h, 
since they claim that pi is not part of the ANSI definition; therefore, I
have placed the definition of pi directly into the primitivs.h header 
file. This change affected both the standalone executable and the MEX
function code.

Ported code to MatLab 5.0. There is now a compiler switch in header file
prcomppp.pch which determines if the code is supposed to compile for
MatLab 4.x or 5.x. This switch is in file ibmPc.h for IBM platforms.

MEX function test cases and MatLab M-files are now inside the 4Matlab
folder.

The code now compiles for the IBM PC using the Watcom compiler. Thanks go
to Marcel Breuers. Renamed graphmat.c to graphmat.cc to make it compatible 
with IBM PC compilation. Renamed test.cc to clippoly.cc. Also added assert 
header to appropriate files for IBM PC. Moved one #ifdef mac_h to allow
M_PI define to be seen by both Mac and PC compilers.

Updated M-files to run under both Matlab 4.x and 5.x.

Moved old Mac project files into MatLab.MEX/4Matlab/OldProj.

Ported code to CW Pro R1 (i.e. CW 12).

A dynamic link library (DLL) is now included for IBM PC use with MatLab 
5.x.

Version 1.4: gsl 2/5/97

Fixed failure to handle case gslBug1. I had changed some of Klamer's
code when I first got it, in an attempt to fix another bug, realized 
the changes were incorrect, changed all the code back, but missed 
this piece.

Fixed area calculation routine. I did not get it quite right in 
version 1.2. I also improved the efficiency of the orientation 
routine. Since it parallels the area calculation code it was tuned 
at the same time.

Version 1.3: ks 1/27/97

Fixed failure to handle pathological case where vertex intersected an
edge and caused a self-intersecting polygon to be output. Case is
shown in ztBug1.

Version 1.2: gsl 1/24/97

Fixed failure of intersection code to handle two pathological cases 
shown in cases jkBug1 and jkBug2 which failed due to rounding errors 
on the order of 10^-16.

Removed extra calculations in polyArea function.

Version 1.1: gsl

Fixed failure for degenerate case nasty1. This fix allows clippoly 
to produce self-intersections near a vertex, but prevents a crash.

Version 1.0: gsl

Ported code from its UNIX origin to the Macintosh.

It is now a standalone application and a MatLab MEX
function.

Released port to the world at large.
