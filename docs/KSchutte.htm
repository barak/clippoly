That's me. From March 1 1994 to December 31 1995 I was working with the <A HREF="http://www.ph.tn.tudelft.nl/pr-intro.html">Pattern Recognition Group</A>
<P>
Currently I am employed by 
<A HREF="http://www.tno.nl/instit/fel/felmain.html">TNO Physics and Electronics
Laboratory</A> working in the
<A HREF="http://www.tno.nl/instit/fel/div4/feldiv43.html"> Electro Optics</A>

In Februari 1994 I got my PhD on the thesis "Knowledge
Based Recognition of Man-Made Objects". An 
<A HREF="samenvatting/chapterstar2_1.html">abstract in Dutch</A>
is available, as well as a 
<A HREF="abstract.html">shorter abstract in English</A>,
but not the complete thesis, due to disk space
(and network bandwidth) reasons. Please contact me if you are interested in
my thesis.<P>

My current research project is the model-based analysis of sequences
of images. Spatial and modality sequences of scanned maps are under
study. 
<BR>
Currently, I am working on papers on:
<UL>
<LI> Mosaicking of scanned maps
<LI> Recognition of buildings from multiple aerial images (to be submitted: 
Real Soon Now)
<LI> Improving segmentation by using shape knowledge
<LI> An interactive tool for 3D scene analysis (submitted: june 1995 to CVIP)
<LI> <A HREF="clip.ps.gz">Polygon clipping</A>
<A HREF="clip.uue">uuencoded version</A> (submitted 7 july 1995 to ACM ToG)
</UL>
<BR>
A paper on
mosaicking of scanned maps
<A HREF="mosaic/mosaic.html"> (html version)</A>
<A HREF="mosaic.ps.gz"> (PostScript version)
</A> <A HREF="mosaic.uue">uuencoded PostScript version</A> is available, as well as a 
<A HREF="http://utelmi01.el.utwente.nl:1994/info/mi-projects/mais/reports/ASCI/html/hypogen/hypogen.html">html</A> and a
<A HREF="http://utelmi01.el.utwente.nl:1994//info/mi-projects/mais/reports/ASCI/hypogen.ps">PostScript</A> version of a paper on generating
object hypotheses from multiple image.<P>

A <A HREF="publikaties.html">publication list</A> is available.

<H2><A NAME="software">Available Software</A></H2>

I have made some software available. Feedback on the code is
appreciated.

<P><strong>
A note on downloading: currently I have no ftp directory to store the
files on, so they are available by http only. This means that you
explicitely have to select a download option on your WWW browser;
in general, clicking and saving the file does NOT work.
<br>
Special notice for Windows 95 users: the Netscape 2.01 GOLD browser for 
Windows 95 seems not ignore the .gz suffix for .tar.gz files. This will
lead to errors for using tar only. You >>have<< to use gunzip to decompress
the files!
<br>
For all those files an uuencoded version also has been made available.
Those files do not contain binary characters and thus should be downloaded
without any problems.

Clippoly is an algorithm to clip two polygons. 
A 
<A HREF="appendices/appendices.html">description of the algorithm</A>
is available as well as
<A HREF="clippoly.html">some comments about the code</A>. 
On 7 July 1995 I have submitted a <A HREF="clip.ps.gz">paper</A>
<A HREF="clip.uue">uuencoded version</A>  on this algorithm to ACM
Transactions on Graphics. (New news: this paper is not accepted by ToG
-- they thought it was too similar to Weiler-Atherton.)
The <A HREF="clippoly.tar.gz">gzipped tar file (patchlevel 6)</A>
<A HREF="clippoly.uue">uuencoded version</A> 
contains the source code, but not all the descriptions mentioned above.

My hobby's include field hockey, sailing, squash, and skiing. Besides that, I
spend quite some time on reading and (blush, blush) computer programming.

<P>
I also run a business called 'La Linea'. It is a psychological consultancy firm.
It is targeted into getting unemployed people back to work.
